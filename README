- Livereload: Needed for a good display of the loading page. Livereload makes every file reload automatically when it is changed.
There appears to still be a bug with livereload on Docker, so it is possible that this part of the server will be replaced by javascript code with the same functionality.

- RabbitMQ: Needed as server where celery executes its tasks.

- Celery: Used as queuing system to execute tasks synchronously. Executes all computationally intensive tasks such as running the algorithm or processing results.

- Django: The server for running and processing requests.


What is where:

Most of the settings for the server are in settings.py, such as the communication between Django, Celery and RabbitMQ. There are comments which line is used to do what.

Templates (HTML pages visible to the user) are connected in a file called "urls.py" with a function that processes the request for each template.
